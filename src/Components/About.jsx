        Why do I do the things I do? 
        </p>
        <p> 
        I deeply contemplate the motivations behind my behavior as a means of understanding myself, whether itâ€™s an execution of values, an impulse of emotions, or a response to situational factors. These motives communicate both identity and tendencies, offering insights into the temporality of each passing state in which I exist. As such, I was happy to make a small part of that process - viewing actions as a window to our thoughts and feelings -  a part of my project and share the same musings with other people. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I find particular interest in experimental games and thought dilemmas because they consist of base units of logic applicable across various contexts, while also yielding insights about a person in a light-hearted, hypothetical presentation. The controlled environment that thought experiments are depicted in minimizes the impact of situational factors and other persuasive contexts have on decision making. As a result, such decisions more closely represent our internal beliefs and typically take the form of an action in a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the focus of the project is to make values more tangible, and in doing so, I hope to make thought experiments more enjoyable. Through improving the tangibility of actions, these efforts give some tangibility to values upheld when thinking through the scenarios presented.
