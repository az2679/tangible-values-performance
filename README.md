# Tangible Values - Exploring Generosity, Altruism, Cooperation, and Trust in the Digital Realm

**Keywords:** Values, Experimental Games, Digital/3D, Psychology, Reflection

This project is an interactive website with 3D elements that showcase 4 thought experiments and allow for people to act upon the decision presented in each thought experiment prompt.

Traveling past the introductory foyer, you will come across an onboarding experience demonstrated through the Dictator Game. Upon completion, I invite you to freely navigate to areas presenting the Volunteer Dilemma, Exchange Game, and Trust Game. In each area, a floating diamond will be your point of contact, revealing the areaâ€™s respective thought experiment prompt and relaying instructions on completing the corresponding interactive component.

The goal of this project is to make the experience of thought experiments more engaging by improving the tangibility of values upheld whilst thinking through the various scenarios. The implementations I have made are centered around adding interactivity to conventionally written text, using technology to showcase this experience visually in a digital realm and representing decisions made with actions taken. In making values more tangible, I hope to inspire reflection on what people care about and possible reasons behind their actions.
